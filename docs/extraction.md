# Customizing Extraction

Information extraction is a central capability of the GenAIIDP solution, transforming unstructured document content into structured data. This guide explains how to customize extraction for your specific use cases, including few-shot prompting and CachePoint optimization.

## Extraction Configuration

Configure extraction behavior through several components:

### Document Classes and Attributes

Specify document classes and the fields to extract from each:

```yaml
classes:
  - name: "invoice"
    description: "A billing document listing items/services, quantities, prices, payment terms, and transaction totals"
    attributes:
      - name: "invoice_number"
        description: "The unique identifier for this invoice, typically labeled as 'Invoice #', 'Invoice Number', or similar"
      - name: "invoice_date"
        description: "The date when the invoice was issued, typically labeled as 'Date', 'Invoice Date', or similar"
      - name: "due_date"
        description: "The date by which payment is due, typically labeled as 'Due Date', 'Payment Due', or similar"
```

### Extraction Instructions

### Model and Prompt Configuration

Configure the extraction model and prompting strategy:

```yaml
extraction:
  # Model selection and parameters
  model: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0
  temperature: 0.0
  top_p: 0.1
  top_k: 5
  max_tokens: 4096
  
  # Prompts for extraction
  system_prompt: |
    You are an expert in extracting structured information from documents.
    Focus on accuracy in identifying key fields based on their descriptions.
    For each field, look for both the field label and the associated value.
    Pay attention to formatting patterns common in business documents.
    When a field is not present, indicate this explicitly rather than guessing.
    
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    <few_shot_examples>
    {FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}
    </few_shot_examples>
    
    <<CACHEPOINT>>
    
    Here is the document to analyze:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    Format your response as valid JSON:
    {
      "field_name": "extracted value",
      ...
    }
```

The extraction service automatically detects and parses both JSON and YAML responses from the LLM, making the structured data available for downstream processing.

## Image Placement with {DOCUMENT_IMAGE} Placeholder

The extraction service supports precise control over where document images are positioned within your extraction prompts using the `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder. This feature allows you to specify exactly where images should appear in your prompt template, enabling better multimodal extraction by strategically positioning visual content relative to text instructions.

### How {DOCUMENT_IMAGE} Works

**Without Placeholder (Default Behavior):**
```yaml
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    Document text:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    Respond with valid JSON.
```
Images are automatically appended after the text content.

**With Placeholder (Controlled Placement):**
```yaml
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    Examine this document image:
    {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
    
    Text content:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    Respond with valid JSON containing the extracted values.
```
Images are inserted exactly where `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` appears in the prompt.

### Usage Examples

**Visual-First Extraction:**
```yaml
task_prompt: |
  You are extracting data from a {DOCUMENT_CLASS}. Here are the fields to find:
  {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
  
  First, examine the document layout and visual structure:
  {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
  
  Now analyze the extracted text:
  {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
  
  Extract the requested fields as JSON:
```

**Image for Context and Verification:**
```yaml
task_prompt: |
  Extract these fields from a {DOCUMENT_CLASS}:
  {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
  
  Document text (may contain OCR errors):
  {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
  
  Use this image to verify and correct any unclear information:
  {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
  
  Extracted data (JSON format):
```

**Mixed Content Analysis:**
```yaml
task_prompt: |
  You are processing a {DOCUMENT_CLASS} that may contain both text and visual elements like tables, stamps, or signatures.
  
  Target fields: {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
  
  Document image (shows full layout):
  {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
  
  Extracted text (may miss visual-only elements):
  {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
  
  Extract all available information as JSON:
```

### Integration with Few-Shot Examples

The `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder works seamlessly with few-shot examples:

```yaml
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract fields from {DOCUMENT_CLASS} documents. Here are examples:
    
    {FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}
    
    Now process this new document:
    
    Visual layout:
    {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
    
    Text content:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    Fields to extract: {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    JSON response:
```

### Benefits for Extraction

- **🎯 Enhanced Accuracy**: Visual context helps identify field locations and correct OCR errors
- **📊 Table and Form Handling**: Better extraction from structured layouts like tables and forms
- **✍️ Handwritten Content**: Improved handling of signatures, handwritten notes, and annotations
- **🖼️ Visual-Only Elements**: Extract information from stamps, logos, checkboxes, and visual indicators
- **🔍 Verification**: Use images to verify and correct text extraction results
- **📱 Layout Understanding**: Better comprehension of document structure and field relationships

### Multi-Page Document Handling

For documents with multiple pages, the system provides robust image management:

- **Automatic Pagination**: Images are processed in page order
- **Bedrock Compliance**: Maximum 20 images per request (automatically enforced)
- **Smart Truncation**: Excess images are dropped with warning logs
- **Performance Optimization**: Large image sets are efficiently handled

```yaml
# Example configuration for multi-page invoices
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract data from this multi-page {DOCUMENT_CLASS}:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    Document pages (up to 20 images):
    {DOCUMENT_IMAGE}
    
    Combined text from all pages:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    Return JSON with extracted fields:
```

### Best Practices for Image Placement

1. **Place Images Before Complex Instructions**: Show the document before giving detailed extraction rules
2. **Use Images for Verification**: Position images after text to help verify and correct extractions
3. **Leverage Visual Context**: Use images when extracting from tables, forms, or structured layouts
4. **Handle OCR Limitations**: Use images to fill gaps where OCR may miss visual-only content
5. **Consider Document Types**: Different document types benefit from different image placement strategies

## Using CachePoint for Extraction

CachePoint is a feature of select Bedrock models that caches partial computations to improve performance and reduce costs. When used with extraction, it provides:

- Cached processing for portions of the prompt
- Improved consistency across similar document types
- Reduced processing costs and latency
- Faster inference times

### Enabling CachePoint

CachePoint is enabled by placing special `<<CACHEPOINT>>` tags in your prompt templates. These indicate where the model should cache preceding components of the prompt:

```yaml
extraction:
  model: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0  # Must be a CachePoint-compatible model
  task_prompt: |
    <background>
    You are an expert in business document analysis and information extraction.
    </background>
    
    <<CACHEPOINT>>  # Cache the instruction portion
    
    Here is the document to analyze:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
```

### Supported Models

CachePoint is currently supported by the following models:

- `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`
- `us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`
- `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`
- `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`

### Cost Benefits

CachePoint significantly reduces token costs for cached portions:

```yaml
pricing:
  - name: bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0
    units:
      - name: inputTokens
        price: '8.0E-7'
      - name: outputTokens
        price: '4.0E-6'
      - name: cacheReadInputTokens  # Reduced rate for cached content
        price: '8.0E-8'             # 10x cheaper than standard input tokens
      - name: cacheWriteInputTokens
        price: '1.0E-6'
```

### Optimal CachePoint Placement

For extraction tasks, place CachePoint tags to separate:
1. **Static content** (system instructions, few-shot examples) - cacheable
2. **Dynamic content** (document text, specific attributes) - not cacheable

This ensures the expensive parts of your prompt that remain unchanged across documents are efficiently cached.

## Extraction Attributes

The solution comes with predefined extraction attributes for common document types:

### Invoice Documents

- `invoice_number`: Unique invoice identifier
- `invoice_date`: Date of invoice issuance

## Adding Custom Attributes

You can define custom extraction attributes through the Web UI:

1. Navigate to the Configuration section
2. Select the Extraction Attributes tab
3. Choose the document class to modify
4. Click "Add New Attribute"
5. Provide:
   - Attribute name (machine-readable identifier)
   - Display name (human-readable name)
   - Detailed description (to guide extraction)
   - Optional formatting hints (e.g., date format)
6. Save changes

## Advanced Extraction Techniques

### Few-Shot Extraction

Improve extraction accuracy by providing examples within each document class configuration:

```yaml
classes:
  - name: "invoice"
    description: "A billing document for goods or services"
    attributes:
      - name: "invoice_number"
        description: "The unique identifier for this invoice"
      # Other attributes...
    examples:
      - name: "SampleInvoice1"
        attributesPrompt: |
          Expected attributes are:
            "invoice_number": "INV-12345"
            "invoice_date": "2023-04-15"
            "total_amount": "$1,234.56"
        imagePath: "config_library/pattern-2/examples/invoice-samples/invoice1.jpg"
      # Additional examples...
```

The extraction service will use these examples as context when processing similar documents. To use few-shot examples in your extraction prompts, include the `{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}` placeholder:

```yaml
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    <few_shot_examples>
    {FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}
    </few_shot_examples>
    
    Now extract the attributes from this document:
    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
```

Examples are class-specific - only examples from the same document class being processed will be included in the prompt.

## Image Processing Configuration

The extraction service supports configurable image dimensions for optimal performance and quality:

### Default Configuration

```yaml
extraction:
  model: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0
  # Image processing settings
  image:
    target_width: 951    # Default width in pixels
    target_height: 1268  # Default height in pixels
```

### Custom Image Dimensions

Configure image dimensions based on your extraction requirements:

```yaml
# For high-accuracy extraction with detailed visual analysis
extraction:
  image:
    target_width: 1200
    target_height: 1600

# For fast processing with standard resolution
extraction:
  image:
    target_width: 800
    target_height: 1000
```

### Image Resizing Features

- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Images are resized proportionally without distortion
- **Smart Scaling**: Only downsizes images when necessary (scale factor < 1.0)
- **High-Quality Resampling**: Better visual quality after resizing for improved field detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized images reduce processing time and memory usage

### Configuration Benefits for Extraction

- **Enhanced Field Detection**: Appropriate image resolution improves accuracy for table and form extraction
- **Visual Element Processing**: Better handling of signatures, stamps, checkboxes, and visual indicators
- **OCR Error Correction**: Higher quality images help verify and correct text extraction results
- **Service-Specific Tuning**: Optimize image dimensions for different document types and extraction complexity
- **Runtime Configuration**: Adjust image processing without code changes
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance quality and performance based on extraction requirements

## JSON and YAML Output Support

The extraction service supports both JSON and YAML output formats from LLM responses, with automatic format detection and parsing:

### Automatic Format Detection

The system automatically detects whether the LLM response is in JSON or YAML format:

```yaml
# JSON response (traditional)
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields and respond with JSON:
    {
      "invoice_number": "extracted value",
      "total_amount": "extracted value"
    }

# YAML response (more token-efficient)
extraction:
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields and respond with YAML:
    invoice_number: extracted value
    total_amount: extracted value
```

### Token Efficiency Benefits

YAML format provides significant token savings for extraction tasks:

- **10-30% fewer tokens** than equivalent JSON
- No quotes required around keys
- More compact syntax for nested structures
- Natural support for multiline content
- Cleaner representation of complex extracted data

### Example Prompt Configurations

**JSON-focused extraction prompt:**
```yaml
extraction:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a document assistant. Respond only with JSON. Never make up data, only provide data found in the document being provided.
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document and return a JSON object:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    Document text: {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    JSON response:
```

**YAML-focused extraction prompt:**
```yaml
extraction:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a document assistant. Respond only with YAML. Never make up data, only provide data found in the document being provided.
  task_prompt: |
    Extract the following fields from this {DOCUMENT_CLASS} document and return YAML:
    
    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}
    
    Document text: {DOCUMENT_TEXT}
    
    YAML response:
```

### Complex Data Structure Examples

**JSON format for nested extraction:**
```json
{
  "vendor_info": {
    "name": "ACME Corporation",
    "address": "123 Main St, City, State 12345"
  },
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "Widget A",
      "quantity": 5,
      "unit_price": 10.00
    },
    {
      "description": "Widget B", 
      "quantity": 2,
      "unit_price": 25.00
    }
  ]
}
```

**Equivalent YAML format (more compact):**
```yaml
vendor_info:
  name: ACME Corporation
  address: 123 Main St, City, State 12345
line_items:
  - description: Widget A
    quantity: 5
    unit_price: 10.00
  - description: Widget B
    quantity: 2
    unit_price: 25.00
```

### Backward Compatibility

- All existing JSON-based extraction prompts continue to work unchanged
- The system automatically detects and parses both formats
- No configuration changes required for existing deployments
- Intelligent fallback between formats if parsing fails

### Implementation Details

The extraction service uses the new `extract_structured_data_from_text()` function which:

- Automatically detects JSON vs YAML format
- Provides robust parsing with multiple extraction strategies
- Handles malformed content gracefully
- Returns both parsed data and detected format for logging
- Supports complex nested structures and arrays

### Token Efficiency Example

For a typical invoice extraction with 10 fields:

**JSON format (traditional):**
```json
{"invoice_number": "INV-2024-001", "invoice_date": "2024-03-15", "vendor_name": "ACME Corp", "total_amount": "1,234.56", "tax_amount": "123.45", "subtotal": "1,111.11", "due_date": "2024-04-15", "payment_terms": "Net 30", "customer_name": "John Smith", "customer_address": "456 Oak Ave, City, State 67890"}
```

**YAML format (more efficient):**
```yaml
invoice_number: INV-2024-001
invoice_date: 2024-03-15
vendor_name: ACME Corp
total_amount: 1,234.56
tax_amount: 123.45
subtotal: 1,111.11
due_date: 2024-04-15
payment_terms: Net 30
customer_name: John Smith
customer_address: 456 Oak Ave, City, State 67890
```

The YAML version uses approximately 25% fewer tokens while maintaining the same information content.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Attribute Descriptions**: Include detail on where and how information appears in the document. More specific descriptions lead to better extraction results.

2. **Balance Precision and Recall**: Decide whether false positives or false negatives are more problematic for your use case and adjust the prompt accordingly.

3. **Optimize Few-Shot Examples**: Select diverse, representative examples that cover common variations in your document formats and challenging edge cases.

4. **Use CachePoint Strategically**: Position CachePoint tags to maximize caching of static content while isolating dynamic content, placing them right before document text is introduced.

5. **Leverage Image Examples**: When providing few-shot examples with `imagePath`, ensure the images highlight the key fields to extract, especially for visually complex documents.

6. **Monitor Evaluation Results**: Use the evaluation framework to identify extraction issues and iteratively refine your prompts and examples.

7. **Choose Appropriate Models**: Select models based on your task requirements:
   - `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` - Best for complex extraction with few-shot learning
   - `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0` - Good balance of performance vs. cost
   - `us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` - Highest accuracy for specialized tasks

8. **Handle Document Variations**: Consider creating separate document classes for significantly different layouts of the same document type rather than trying to handle all variations with a single class.

9. **Test Extraction Pipeline End-to-End**: Validate your extraction configuration with the full pipeline including OCR, classification, and extraction to ensure components work together effectively.

10. **Optimize Image Dimensions**: Configure image dimensions based on document complexity - use higher resolution for forms and tables, standard resolution for simple text documents.

11. **Balance Quality vs Performance**: Higher resolution images provide better extraction accuracy but consume more resources and processing time.
